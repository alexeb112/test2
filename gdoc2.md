Updated: 3/19/2020

**This document is a work in progress. We have much to learn.** 
**This is updated daily with evolving information; do not print.**

<ins>SCCM Guidelines</ins> **are being reviewed and incorporated but are not yet reflected in this document**

**Please send suggestions:** 
**Disclaimer:** This document is intended as a resource for clinicians caring for critically-ill COVID-19 patients, based on available evidence and recommendations of governing bodies. The recommendations do not replace clinical judgment or the need for individualized patient care plans. While we attempt to keep this document up-to-date, the literature on COVID-19 is rapidly evolving, and we suggest that practitioners search for the most up-to-date literature on any specific topic. These guidelines will also rapidly evolve as they are implemented into clinical practice and we receive feedback from practitioners. Finally, these guidelines were developed based on practice patterns and infrastructure at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, MA; local factors should be taken into account if utilized at other hospitals.

#Chapter 1: Non-ICU Management, Triage, Transfers

##Clinical Course of COVID-19 

  1. **Clinical presentation:** non-specific, flu-like illness
    1. Fever (44-98%) 
    1. Cough (46-82%)
    1. Shortness of breath (20-64%)
    1. Upper respiratory symptoms, nasal / sinus congestion  (5-25%)
    1. GI symptoms (10%; usually before respiratory symptoms)
  1. **Transmission:**
    1. Large droplets and fomites
      1. Viral particles survive < 24h on cardboard, < 72h on plastic or steel (van Dorelmalen et al, New Engl J Med 2020)
    1. Aerosols (droplet nuclei, < 5 um), estimated < 4h 
    1. Incubation period: median 4 days, common range 2-7 days, up to 24 days
    1. Symptomatic and asymptomatic patients can transmit the virus
  1. **Course for admitted patients**: 
    1. ~ 80% do not require critical care
    1. ~ 10-20% develop bacterial superinfection 
    1. ~ 20% have respiratory viral co-infection (unpublished report, CA-DPH)
    1. ~ 20% develop ARDS
    1. ~ 5% develop renal injury requiring renal replacement therapy 
    1. Elevated AST / ALT (~200s) is common; fulminant hepatitis not reported
    1. Cardiomyopathy in critically ill patients; some progress to cardiogenic shock late in course (anecdotal reports)
  1. **Reasons for ICU admission:**
    1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure is the most common indication for ICU.
      1. Reports of rapid progression to intubation within 12-24h
    1. Few patients with shock, can develop late in course
    1. Median time from symptom onset to ICU transfer is ~10 days
  1. **Poor prognostic indicators:**
    1. Demographics: Age > 65, male
    1. Comorbidities: cardiovascular disease (includes hypertension), pulmonary disease, diabetes, malignancy, immunosuppression
    1. Lab findings: severe lymphopenia, elevated troponin, elevated creatinine, elevated LDH, elevated CRP, elevated D-dimer
  1. **Cause of death:**
    1. ~53% respiratory failure
    1. ~33% concomitant respiratory and heart failure
    1. ~7% cardiac or heart failure alone
    1. Mortality rate appears to correlate with age and availability of medical resources (Ruan et al, Intensive Care Med, 2020)

##Non-ICU Management Principles
  1. **Diagnostic studies:** 
    1. Labs & EKG: 
      1. On admission: CBC with differential, BMP, LFTs, LDH, CRP, D-dimer, Troponin / CPK, PTT / INR, Procalcitonin, baseline EKG
      1. Daily: CBC with differential, BMP
        1. For stable floor patients, consider every other day
      1. Every other day: LFTs, LDH, CRP, D-dimer, Troponin / CPK (if in ICU), Triglycerides (if on propofol) 
      1. If clinical worsening: LFTs, LDH, CRP, D-dimer, Troponin, CPK, PTT / INR, Procalcitonin, Ferritin, Fibrinogen, EKG 
      1. Expert opinion does not recommend routine pro-BNP. 
    1. Chest imaging: Portable CXR is sufficient in most cases. Avoid routine daily CXR (unlikely to change management, evaluate case-by-case).
      1. Chest imaging variable; bilateral patchy opacities most common
      1. Chest CT often will not change treatment; obtain only if necessary (risk of transmission, time associated with transport / decontamination of equipment)
      1. Point of Care Ultrasound of the lungs can be used but by experienced providers only
    1. Obtain additional studies only if necessary
      1. Avoid routine TTEs (for cardiac studies, see  “Cardiac Complications of COVID” chapter).
  1. **Medical management:**
    1. Further details in “COVID Therapies and Clinical Trials” chapter
    1. Management is largely supportive
    1. Fluid management should be conservative due to risk of hypoxia/CHF
    1. Antiviral and immune-modulating therapies are investigational 
  1. **Early Advance Care Planning:**
    1. In conscious patients, review or sign Health Care Proxy form 
    1. Discuss and document goals of care on admission
      1. Educate patient and family on disease course 
      1. Focus on desired quality of life and tolerance for ICU measures
        1. Avoid implying availability of ICU measures if unknown (refer to local ethics guidance)
  1. **Avoid increasing risk of transmission:** Generally avoid transport if possible.
    1. Further details in “COVID Therapies and Clinical Trials” chapter
    1. Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV: BiPAP, CPAP), High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC), Humidified Venturi Face Masks, Nebulizers increase aerosolization. 
      1. <ins>Any aerosol-generating intervention must be performed under Strict (Airborne) Isolation Precautions, in a negative pressure room.</ins> 
      1. In current policy, patients with <ins>severe OSA</ins> may continue nocturnal CPAP / BiPAP but <ins>must use a BWH</ins> NIPPV <ins>mask</ins> and <ins>machine</ins>, not their home mask or nasal pillows which have elevated aerosol risk. BWH machines have dual limb (with HEPA filter); in contrast, home machines have a single limb so they have an anti-asphyxiation (pop-off) valve that increases aerosol risk. 
        1. Transition back to home machine if COVID-19 ruled out
      1. Use metered dose inhalers instead of nebulizers. 
        1. Transition back to nebs if COVID-19 ruled out
      1. If patient already on BiPAP / CPAP / HFNC becomes COVID-suspected, transition to non-rebreather followed by intubation.
      1. NIPPV* is not used for ARDS; early intubation is preferred. 
*Can be considered on a case-by-case basis for highly reversible indications (e.g., flash pulmonary edema with rapid resolution). 
      1. Similar to many U.S. medical centers, our current default is to avoid HFNC in DNI patients and to use NRB, although exceptions can be considered on a case-by-case basis.

##Triage to ICU

  1. **Consult the ICU triage team EARLY for:** 
    1. Provider concern
    1. Respiratory distress
      1. Need O2 > 6 LPM to maintain SpO2 > 92 or PaO2 > 65.
      1. Rapid escalation of oxygen requirement.
      1. Significant work of breathing.
    1. Hemodynamic instability after initial conservative fluid resuscitation 
      1. SBP < 90, Mean arterial pressure < 65, or Heart rate > 120.
    1. Acidosis
      1. ABG with pH < 7.3 or PCO2 > 50 or above patient’s baseline.
      1. Lactate > 2.
    1. Need for intensive nursing care or frequent laboratory draws requiring arterial line.
    1. Severe comorbid illness / high risk for deterioration.

##Transfer Process 

  1. **Additional details in Strict Isolation Procedures Manual.**
  1. **Floor / ED to ICU:**
    1. ICU RN brings ICU bed to the floor for transfer (to avoid bed transfer in COVID precautions room and subsequent bed cleaning).
    1. Patient wears surgical mask, with an extra clean gown and sheet on top.   
    1. Providers wear standard PPE during transport.
    1. Security facilitates the shortest and fastest transfer route, walks 6 ft away from patient and providers, not required to wear PPE
    1. Necessary tests (e.g. CT), should be obtained during transfer if possible.
  1. **ICU to floor:** 
    1. RN wears standard PPE
    1. Patient travels in wheelchair or stretcher
    1. Security facilitates the shortest and fastest transfer route, walks 6 ft away from patient and providers, not required to wear PPE
  1. **Floor to discharge: s****ee separate documentation of discharge criteria/ planning** 
    1. RN wears standard PPE
    1. Patient travels in wheelchair 
    1. Security facilitates the shortest and fastest transfer route, walks 6 ft away from patient and providers, not required to wear PPE
    1. Patient is escorted directly into vehicle; contact care management if patient does not have access to a personal vehicle
#Chapter 2: Respiratory Support for COVID-19 Patients

##Respiratory Failure and ARDS 

  1. **Pathophysiology:** 
    1. Histology shows bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates, desquamation of pneumocytes, pulmonary edema, and hyaline membrane formation (Xu et al., Lancet Respir Med, 2020)
    1. Some evidence of direct viral injury to lung tissue, rather than purely hyperinflammatory process (Xu et al., Lancet Respir Med, 2020)
  1. **Time course:**
    1. Anecdotal reports that progression of hypoxemic respiratory failure occurs rapidly (within ~12-24 hours)
    1. From onset of symptoms, median time to: 
      1. Development of ARDS:       1. Mechanical ventilation: 10.5-14.5 days (Huang et al., Lancet, 2020; Zhou et al., Lancet, 2020)

##Management of Hypoxemia

  1. **Supplemental Oxygen:**
    1. Humidified nasal cannula (NC) 1 to 6 LPM for target SpO2 92-96%
  1. **Escalation:** 
    1. If a patient requires > 6 LPM NC, initiate dry Venturi mask (non-humidified to reduce aerosolization risk) 
      1. Start Venturi mask at 9 LPM and FiO2 28%
      1. Up-titrate FiO2 to goal SpO2 of 92-96% (not exceeding FiO2 35%)
      1. If FiO2 > 35% then increase flow to 12 LPM
    1. Notify ICU triage pager
  1. **Avoid high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV;** **i.e.** **CPAP/BiPAP) for ARDS.**
    1. Patients on nocturnal NIPPV at home should continue their nocturnal NIPPV. However, patient must use BWH NIPPV <ins>mask</ins> and <ins>machine</ins> (not home mask/nasal pillow or machine due to increased aerosol risk with home pillows/mask/machine) under strict airborne precautions.   
    1. If a patient already on HFNC or NIPPV becomes a COVID-19 PUI, transition to non-rebreather if safe
      1. Ideally, the patient should be off an aerosol generating device like  HFNC or NIPPV for 45 minutes prior to intubation, but it is definitely not a requirement.  
    1. If a patient is DNR/DNI or otherwise is not eligible for intubation: 
      1. **Current policy is to default to avoiding HFNC or NIPPV in DNI / DNR patients. However, neither HFNC nor NIPPV is prohibited and case-by-case exceptions could apply.** 
      1. This is an evolving area without definitive evidence or uniform policy that underwent multi-disciplinary discussion. 
      1. Considerations include: 
1. Safety of staff (particularly Resp. Therapy and nursing);
1. Paucity of data on the increased aerosol risk; 
1. WHO interim guidelines (published 2020 Mar 13) on COVID-19 are more liberal about the usage of HFNC and NIPPV, stating that systems with “good interface fitting [i.e., good seal, no air leak] do not create widespread dispersion of exhaled air and therefore should be associated with low risk of airborne transmission.” 
1. Difficulty in assessing how many patients that fail Non-Rebreathing mask would survive if given HFNC. 
1. Pro-active treatment of air hunger through other means.
1. HFNC has been utilized in lieu of ventilation of both full code and DNI / DNR patients in the setting of limited resources. 
If HFNC or NIPPV used
        1. For HFNC, have patient wear a surgical mask if possible. and try to limit flow rate to < 30 L/min
        1. For BiPAP, use an in-line viral filter.
        1. Ensure masks/devices fit well and there is no air leak, as leaks propel potentially infected air significant distances (see below)
    1. Rationale: General consensus suggests that HFNC and NIPPV increase the risk of viral transmission. Given the rapid progression of disease, we do not expect many patients can be salvaged/avoid intubation using HFNC/NIPPV, but this is unknown
      1. A systematic review on SARS found that NIPPV was associated with increased risk of viral transmission to healthcare workers (n=2 studies), but HFNC was not (n=1) (Tran et al., PLoS One, 2012)
      1. Other studies with very limited power exist, such as a post-hoc analysis that found no secondary infections in medical staff from patients with influenza H1N1 treated with HFNC but was limited to only n=20 (Rello et al., J Crit Care. 2012);        1. Exhaled air distances are minimally increased with CPAP pressures up to 20 cm H2O and HFNC up to 60 LPM; device/interface leaks cause significant lateral air travel (Hui et al., Eur Respir Ji, 2019)
  1. **Early intubation:** 
    1. If FiO2 requirements are rising rapidly, we recommend early consultation with anesthesia for possible intubation
      1. Case reports from China suggest high failure rates for non-invasive ventilation, including high-flow nasal oxygen (Zuo et al., Chin Med Sci J, 2020)
    1. Once FiO2=60% and SpO2 < 92%, call for intubation if patient is a candidate for mechanical ventilation 
      1. There is a COVID Airway Code Team with specific protocols for avoiding aerosolization.
      1. Many centers suggest Rapid Sequence Intubation when fully paralyzed, without ambu-bag (which generates aerosols) and highly experienced operators (e.g., anesthesia attending). 
    1. Other indications for intubation (tachypnea, work of breathing) apply 
 ##Initial Mechanical Ventilation

  1. **Intubations outside of ICU:**
    1. Should be attended by the Resource RT, who can facilitate early and appropriate ventilator settings with non-intensivists
    1. Use “Mechanical Ventilation with Sedation” orderset 
  1. **Initiate Volume Control (AC/VC) mode** 
  1. **Initial tidal volume (Vt):** 
    1. Vt = 6 ml/kg (based on ideal body weight [IBW] from ARDSnet table -see table)
      1. IBW men (kg)= 50 + 2.3 (height in inches – 60)
      1. IBW women (kg)= 45.5 + 2.3 (height in inches – 60)
![](kix.s00apo8tevqn)
  1. **Initial respiratory rate 16-24, higher if acidosis present**
  1. **Initial PEEP based on BMI:**
    1. BMI < 35: PEEP 10
    1. BMI 35 to 50: PEEP 12
    1. BMI > 50: PEEP 15
  1. **Initial FiO2:** 
    1. 100% immediately post-intubation, then rapidly wean to SpO2 92-96% (Barrot et al., N Engl J Med,   1. **Obtain STAT portable CXR to confirm endotracheal tube location:** 
    1. Order and page radiology at time of intubation 
    1. Prioritize CXR and vent titration over procedures (such as central venous catheter placement) if possible. 
  1. **Within 30 minutes of intubation, obtain an ABG** **(preferred) or a VBG and adjust ventilation and oxygenation as needed**

##PEEP and Mechanics

  1. **If patients supported by Hamilton G5 Ventilator (most common), perform the following within 10 minutes of intubation:**
    1. Determine best PEEP following intubation while paralyzed using Pressure-Volume (PV) tool
      1. This is a departure from use of Best PEEP Trials. PV tool is the preferred method due to widespread familiarity with RT staff, institutional experience, and minimizing provider exposure
  1. **If patients not supported by Hamilton G5 Ventilator, perform the following within 10 minutes of intubation**:
    1. Initiate PEEP at BMI settings above and titrate PEEP according to ARDSnet Lower PEEP table. Currently, after discussion, both MGH and BWH recommend the lower PEEP table as a back-up if PEEP cannot be individualized (e.g., experienced respiratory therapists or intensivists unavailable). The lower (rather than higher) PEEP table was selected primarily to avoid doing initial harm patients with poor lung compliance.
![](kix.5m15sfayy2j1)
  1. **After best PEEP determined, obtain**     1. Plateau pressure (with goal < 30, management below)
    1. Static compliance
  1. **Obtain arterial blood gas:** 
    1. Goal pH 7.25 to 7.45 
    1. Calculate P/F ratio from initial post-intubation ABG
  1. **Routine esophageal balloon use is not recommended**

##Targeting Sedation for Ventilator Synchrony

  1. **Initially target** **RASS -2 to -3 (see table):**
    1. Maintain deep sedation immediately post-intubation while paralyzed (assume 60 minutes for Rocuronium, 10 minutes for succinylcholine)
      1. <ins>Preferred initial sedation regimen</ins>: 
        1. Fentanyl/Hydromorphone (boluses +/- infusion) + Propofol: target analgosedation and optimize analgesia first while decreasing sedative requirements
        1. Measure triglycerides every third day on propofol or earlier if other reasons for hypertriglyceridemia
      1. <ins>Adjunct agent:</ins> Midazolam
      1. <ins>Use dexmedetomidine only when nearing extubation</ins>
  1. **Target ventilator synchrony:** Ventilator-induced lung injury (VALI) is common in patients who are not synchronous with the ventilator and can cause significant lasting damage
    1. Once at target RASS after paralytics have worn off, assess patient synchrony with the ventilator (e.g. signs of breath-stacking, double triggering, other ventilator alarms)
      1. Titrate sedatives/analgesics to ventilator synchrony allowing for deeper RASS
      1. If patient remains dyssynchronous despite deep sedation (RASS -5), initiate continuous paralytics (ensure BIS 40 to 60 prior to initiating and during paralysis)
![](kix.roexne69lgme)

##General Management of Ventilated ARDS Patients

  1. **Consider whether patient requires daily CXR:** 
    1. CXR clearly indicated for: 
      1. Clinical change 
      1. Concern for displaced ET tube:
        1. Sudden increase in peak inspiratory pressure or resistance
        1. Decreased, unilateral breath sounds (usually on the right)
        1. RN or RT concern for change in depth of ET tube at teeth 
  1. **COVID-19 ICU Bundle:**
    1. Ventilated patients should all have a daily ICU “Bundle” of best practices. See Addendum 1 for a proposed “COVID-19 ICU Bundle”
  1. **Ventilator consults:**
    1. If you need additional assistance managing ventilator choices, you can request a pulmonary phone/in-person consult (pager 11957) 


##Managing Ventilation

  1. **Follow ARDSnet ventilation where possible:** 
    1. Tidal volumes should be 4-6 cc/kg using IBW (see table above) to minimize volumes (and thus ventilator injury) 
  1. **Minute ventilation (respiratory rate x tidal volume) typically drives pH and PC02:**
    1. Titrate ventilatory parameters to pH, not PCO2 
    1. To achieve low tidal volumes, we tolerate hypercapnia (functionally no limitation unless clinical sequelae) and acidemia (pH > 7.2)
    1. Because tidal volumes are low, the respiratory rate often has to be high to accommodate; typical RR is 20-35 breaths/minute
  1. **pH goal is normally 7.25-7.45:**
    1. If pH > 7.45, decrease respiratory rate
    1. If pH 7.15-7.30, then increase respiratory rate until pH > 7.30, or PaCO2 < 25 (maximum RR= 35 breaths/minute)
    1. If pH < 7.15, then increase respiratory rate to 35 breaths/minute
    1. If pH still < 7.15, then perform the following:
      1. Tidal volume may be increased by 1 mL/kg until pH > 7.15 (until plateau pressure reaches 30 cm H2O or tidal volume reaches 8 cc/kg)
      1. Deep sedation advancing to RASS -5 if needed
      1. If no improvement, initiate continuous paralysis
      1. If still no improvement, initiate prone ventilation (may improve V/Q matching and better ventilation)

##Managing Oxygenation

  1. **Minimizing oxygen toxicity:** 
    1. PEEP and Fi02 drive oxygenation 
    1. The goal is to deliver a partial pressure of oxygen to perfuse tissues (PaO2 > 75, Sp02 >92%) while limiting lung injury from high distending pressures (Ppl < 30) and hyperoxia (FiO2 < 95, SpO2 < 96%).
    1. Lower limit goals for PaO2 / SpO2 are widely debated (and discuss in Rationale); PaO2 > 65 and SpO2 >89% is also commonly used at BWH. 

  1. **PEEP management:**
    1. Initial PEEP should be set as explained in section 4 above. 
    1. If patient is hypoxic on Vt = 6 ml/kg and ideal PEEP from PV tool (or PEEP determination from ARDSnet table for non-Hamilton G5 ventilators), perform the following:
      1. Deep sedation,       1. Initiate continuous paralysis       1. Initiate prone   1. **Checking plateau pressure:**
    1. Check plateau pressure with every change in tidal volume, PEEP, or clinical deterioration (worsening oxygenation) but not as part of routine practice
      1. If plateau pressure is > 30 cm H20, then decrease tidal volume by 1 ml/kg (minimum 4 mL/kg)
      1. If plateau pressure is < 25 H20 and tidal volume < 6 mL/kg, then increase tidal volume by 1 mL/kg until plateau pressure is > 25 cm H2O or tidal volume = 6 mL/kg
      1. If plateau pressure is < 30 cm H20 and patient is breath stacking or dys-synchronous, then increase tidal volume in mL/kg increments to 7 mL/kg or 8 mL/kg so long as plateau pressure is < 30 cm H20
  1. **Adjusting Fi02:**
    1. Adjust Fi02 after optimizing PEEP  
    1. Goal FiO2 < 75%; if FiO2 > 75%; patient requires ventilator optimization. If you need assistance, pulmonary consultation is available (pager 11957)
    1. It is reasonable to put a desaturating patient temporarily on 100% Fi02, but remember to wean oxygen as rapidly as possible
  1. **Rationale**: 
    1. Avoiding hyperoxia: Extensive mammalian animal data demonstrates that hyperoxic injury occurs at an FiO2 ≥ 75% (at sea level) with the rate of injury increasing as FiO2 exceeds that threshold. In multiple mammalian models, an FiO2 of 100% for 48 to 72 hours is associated with nearly 100% mortality rate. In lung injury models, the time to death is markedly attenuated. In an effort to reduce the potential for hyperoxic injury, the threshold of FiO2 ≥ 75% triggers progressive intervention throughout this protocol: increased sedation, paralysis, proning and ECMO consultation. For a review of hyperoxic acute lung injury, see Kallet and Matthay, Respir Care, 2013. 
    1. Setting the lower oxygen limits: There is debate on the proper PaO2 goal, and our rationale relies on evidence for lack of benefit from conservative PaO2 goals in clinical trials (i.e., PaO2 > 55) and past association between lower PaO2 and cognitive impairment, although the evidence is certainly not definitive (mean PaO2 71 [IQR 67-80] for cognitively impaired survivors versus mean PaO2 86 [IQR, 70-98] in non-impaired survivors of ARDS (Mikkelsen et al., Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2012). In the LOCO2 multi-center, randomized clinical trial, patients with ARDS were randomized to their PaO2 55-70, SpO2 88-92%; or PaO2 90-105, SpO2 >95%); the trial was stopped after enrollment of 205 patients due to futility and safety concerns (44% mortality in conservative oxygen group versus 30%; (Barrot et al., New Eng J Med, 2020).

##Proning and Pulmonary Vasodilators

  1. **Prone early:**
    1. We recommend early proning in severe ARDS without vasodilator trial (a depature from our typical practice for ARDS not due to COVID-19): <36 hours from ARDS onset, start discussion of prone when P:F < 150, prone within 12 hours of FiO2 > 75% (Guérin, N Engl J Med, 2013).   1. **Eligibility criteria for proning:**
    1. Eligibility may vary depending on resources and staffing. Currently we recommend: 
      1. Age < 75
      1. No high grade shock (either single agent norepinephrine 20 mcg/min or norepinephrine < 15 mcg/min and vasopressin)
      1. Not on CRRT or at risk of impending renal failure (due to difficulties in maintaining dialysis access while proned)
      1. The only absolute contraindications to proned ventilation are spinal cord injury and open chest; BMI and patient size are not contraindications
  1. **To initiate prone ventilation outside of MICU and 11C:**
    1. Discuss with the PCCM Consultation team assigned to that unit
    1. ICU charge nurse to contact MICU charge nurse for nursing assistance
  1. **Managing a proned patient:** 
    1. Proning protocol is available at the MICU sharepoint
    1. Maintain deep sedation with target RASS -4 to -5 while proned
    1. 1 hour post-initiation of prone ventilation:
      1. Adjust oxygen parameters: re-assess lung mechanics (plateau pressure and P-V tool to determine optimal PEEP) and adjust PEEP and titrate FiO2 as in “Managing Ventilation” (section 7)
      1. Assess tidal volume and adjust ventilation parameters as in section 6
        1. If Vt < 6 ml/kg, may increase to maximum limit of 8 ml/kg while Ppl < 30
    1. If patient demonstrates improvement on proning then recommend:
      1. Discontinuing of continuous neuromuscular blockade and re-assess ventilator dyssynchrony; re-institute if dyssynchronous
      1. Return to supine ventilation when following criteria are met:
        1. Ppl < 25
        1. FiO2 < 50
        1. pH > 7.3
        1. P:F > 200
    1. Repositioning and skin care while proned: 
      1. Currently we recommend continuing proning as per the MICU proning protocol. This may change in the future depending on availability of PPE and staffing.
  1. **Escalation if still hypoxic:**
    1. If hypoxia (PaO2 < 55 with FiO2 > 75) persists after proning; then initiate continuous inhaled epoprostenol (see “COVID-19 Therapies and Clinical Trials” section)
    1. If FiO2 > 75% despite above, recommend consultation with ECMO team (see below)
 
##ECMO consultation

  1. **Refractory Hypoxemia:**
    1. If despite PEEP optimization, paralysis, prone ventilation, optimizing volume status, pulmonary vasodilators (when available) the patient meets the following criteria, then consider ECMO consult (pager 35010)
        1. Ppl > 30
        1. FiO2 > 75%
        1. P:F < 80
  1. **Candidacy:**
    1. Final ECMO guidelines for COVID-19 patients remain under development. Examples of common considerations include:
      1. Patient age < 65
      1. Mechanical ventilation duration < 7 days
      1. BMI < 35 and patient body weight < 150 kg
      1. CrCl > 30
      1. No multiorgan failure or high grade shock (can be on single pressor; norepinephrine < 15 mcg/min)
      1. No active solid or liquid malignancy
      1. Absolute neutrophil count > 500
      1. Platelets > 50,000
      1. Able to tolerate anticoagulation on initiation (no active hemorrhage)
      1. No evidence of irreversible neurological injury
      1. Able to perform ADLs at baseline prior to illness

#Chapter 3: COVID-19 Therapies and Clinical Trials


##Note: 

  1. The anti-viral and anti-inflammatory section below written by our critical care group is meant to provide a summary of the literature. This section does not represent the views or recommendations of the BWH Div. of Infectious Disease. The separate BWH Infectious Disease guidelines and ID consultation service take precedence over the information from the literature below.

##Clinical trials 

  1. **Consult Infectious Disease for:**
    1. Patients with +COVID-19 PCR; and clinical history and any chest imaging suspicious for COVID-19 
    1. Re-consult if the patient develops ARDS (mechanically ventilated with P/F ratio < 300) or shock/cytokine syndrome 
  1. **Current trials:**
    1. ID teams are enrolling for clinical trials of Remdesivir and possibly other antiviral agents
    1. ID and the PETAL network are coordinating to enroll for clinical trials of host-response modifying therapies (see  “Systemic Corticosteroids” and “Anti-IL6 agents” subsections of this chapter)
  1. **Monitor for drug-drug interactions:**
    1. Patients may arrive at the ICU already enrolled in a COVID19 clinical trial.  Verify that ICU treatment regimen does not add harmful drug interactions with study agents 

##Antibiotic stewardship

  1. **Antibiotic choice:**
    1. Antibiotics should reflect IDSA guidelines, presumed source, and MDRO risk. For a presumed pulmonary source: 
      1. Without risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas (i.e. living in community, no prior MDROs): 
        1. Ceftriaxone +       1. With risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas (i.e. chronic hospitalization, prior MDR infections): 
        1. Vancomycin +       1. See special dispensations for oncology patients in chapter 7
  1. **Formulation:**
    1. Give oral antibiotics (Azithromycin, Levofloxacin, Ciprofloxacin) when possible to reduce volume load, unless concerns for poor oral absorption
  1. **Coinfection:**
    1. If concurrent influenza give Oseltamivir
    1. Given lymphopenia consider Pneumocystis and treat accordingly
  1. **Discontinuation:**
    1. Antibiotics should be discontinued as soon as possible (within 48h) if:
      1. Clinical status is not deteriorating, cultures do not reveal pathogens at 48h, and procalcitonin and WBC are relatively stable from 0 to 48h
        1. Clinical judgement should prevail over any specific lab value
  1. **Rationale****:** Clinical reports indicate that rates of bacterial superinfection of COVID19 are low (10-20%), but when present increase mortality risk. Anecdotal reports suggest less MRSA superinfection than with influenza. Unnecessary antibiotics carry risks of fluid overload and drug-resistance, as well as the possibility that antibiotics may become a limited resource. (Zhou et al., Lancet, 2020; Yang et al., Lancet, 2020; Lippi and Plebani, Clinica Chimica Acta,  
##Metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) vs. nebulizers

  1. **N****on-intubated patients:** 
    1. For COVID-19 Confirmed or PUI, use MDI (inhalers), not nebulizers, due to the increased aerosol risk. 
    1. Because MDI supply is limited, only prescribe when needed.  
    1. For non-COVID-19 Confirmed or PUI patient, use nebulizers even if on droplet precautions (e.g., influenza) because MDI supply is limited. 
    1. After a patient is COVID-neg (and no longer on COVID precautions per infection control): After the patient’s current MDI runs out, switch to neb. 
  1. **Intubated patients:** 
    1. The ventilator circuit is a closed system so nebulizers can be used when required (e.g., DuoNeb standing and albuterol PRN). 
  1. **Rationale****:** Nebulization may aerosolize viral particles and contribute to disease transmission.  COVID-19 clinical reports do not indicate wheeze as a common symptom, and not all patients require bronchodilators (Zhou et al, Lancet, 2020; Yang et al, Lancet, 2020; Guan et al, N Engl J Med, 
##Airway Clearance  

  1. **Management principles:**
    1. Reports from Wuhan and Italy indicate that some patients develop very thick secretions causing dangerous mucus plugging. However, nebulizers and airway clearance techniques may aerosolize secretions
    1. Airway clearance should be used only in selected ventilated patients   1. **For t****hinning secretions:**
    1. Anecdotal reports suggest Dornase alfa may be particularly effective in thinning secretions in COVID19 patients. However, data for Dornase alfa in non-CF patients is poor. For now we recommend:
      1. Consideration of Dornase alfa 2.5mg nebulizer once daily 
        1. Can cause bronchoconstriction and mucosal bleeding 
        1. Pre-treat with albuterol 2.5mg, just prior to delivery
        1. Avoid in setting of bloody secretions 
      1. Alternative: Nebulized hypertonic (3-7%) saline once daily
        1. Side effects can include bronchoconstriction
          1. Start with 3% to assess response and bronchoconstriction
          1. Pre-treat with albuterol 2.5mg just prior to delivery
      1. Avoid N-acetylcysteine due to frequent dosing requirements 
  1. **Airway clearance:**  
    1. Continue chest PT vests if patient uses at home (e.g. CF patients) with appropriate isolation precautions. Bronchiectasis patients may be considered on a case-by-case basis 
    1. Avoid oscillating positive expiratory pressure devices (Aerobika or Acapella) and cough assist (MIE) 
##Inhaled Pulmonary Vasodilators

  1. **Indications for use:**
    1. Inhaled vasodilators should not be routinely used except in two circumstances
      1. As a rescue strategy in already prone ventilated patients (see “Respiratory Support for COVID-19 Patients” section). 
        1. There is no evidence of survival benefit of inhaled vasodilators in ARDS, and there are risks of viral aerosolization when connecting the device  (Fuller et al., Chest, 2015; Gebistorf et al., Cochrane Database Syst Rev,       1. To reduce RV afterload in hemodynamically significant RV failure in consultation with cardiology
  1. **Instructions for use:**
    1. If inhaled vasodilators are used, they should reevaluated at 4 hours  
      1. <ins>Inhaled Epoprostenol:</ins> 
        1. Start continuous nebulization at 0.05mcg/kg/min based on IBW  
          1. If no improvement in P/F ratio in 2 hours, wean off by decreasing 0.01mcg/kg/min every hour 
      1. <ins>Inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO):</ins>
        1. Strong consideration in refractory ARDS that does not respond to inhaled epoprostenol.  
          1. Limited in vitro data notes that iNO at high doses inhibits replication of SARS-CoV, but this has not been studied in vivo. (Akerstrom et al., J Virol,           1. iNO may be included in future trial protocols, such as early initiation in milder disease (non-intubated). 

##Systemic Corticosteroids

  1. **Data on** **corticosteroids for COVID-19:**  
    1. Most studies show negative effects of corticosteroids on similar viruses
      1. There is no clinical evidence of net benefit from steroids in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or influenza infection, and observational data show increased mortality, more secondary infections, impaired viral clearance and more adverse effects in survivors (e.g. psychosis, diabetes, avascular necrosis). (Lee et al., J Clin Virol,     1. However, a new retrospective cohort (201 patients, 84 [42%] of whom developed ARDS) demonstrated that among patients with ARDS, methylprednisolone decreased risk of death (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72) (Wu et al., JAMA Int Med,   1. **Recommendation**:
    1. **We recommend against using steroids for COVID-19 except as part of a clinical trial**
      1. This is in line with WHO Guidelines as of 3/13/2020
  1.      1.  Use the lowest dose for the shortest duration:
      1. Asthma or COPD exacerbation
        1. 40mg prednisone PO or 30mg methylprednisolone IV, once daily x 3-5 days
      1. Shock with history of chronic steroid use > 10mg prednisone daily:
        1. 50mg hydrocortisone IV Q6H until improvement in shock 
      1. Multipressor shock without history of chronic steroid use
        1. 50mg hydrocortisone IV Q6H until improvement in shock 
##Anti-IL6 Agents (Tocilizumab, Siltuximab)  

  1. **Pathophysiology:**
    1. IL-6 activates T cells and macrophages, among other cell types (see “Cytokine Activation Syndrome”
      1. IL-6 inhibitors are approved for cytokine activation syndrome complications related to Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy (Brudno & Kochenderfer, Blood Rev,       1.  IL-6 levels are reported to correlate with severe COVID-19 
      1. While patients have peripheral lymphopenia, BAL fluid is often lymphocytic, suggesting that IL-6 inhibition and prevention of T cell activation may be protective
  1. **Recommendation:**
    1. We do not recommend routine use at this time 
      1. There are anecdotal reports of benefit of tocilizumab in COVID19 patients but no rigorous studies are available (Anecdotal reports from Italy; Chinese National Health Commission Clinical Guideline, March 3, 2020.)
    1. For severe cytokine activation syndrome cases (see Chapter 7, “Other Guidance”):
        1. Consult Infectious Disease team for enrollment in a clinical trial based on CRP and IL-6 levels.
          1. Exercise caution if secondary infection is clinically suspected - including sepsis, pneumocystis or bacterial pneumonia 
  1. **Dosing regimens:** 
    1. Tocilizumab 4-8mg/kg (suggested dose 400mg) IV x1 (anti-IL6R mAb)
      1. Dose can be repeated 12h later if inadequate response to first dose.  Total dose should be no more than 800mg. Tocilizumab should not be administered more than twice. 
      1. Common adverse effects include: 
        1. Transaminitis (AST, ALT) > 22%
        1. Infusion reaction 4-20%
        1. Hypercholesterolemia 20%
        1. Upper respiratory tract infection 7%
        1. Neutropenia 2-7%
    1. Alternative: Siltuximab 11mg/kg IV x1 (anti-IL6 mAb)
      1. Common adverse effects include: 
        1. Edema >26%
        1. Upper respiratory infection >26%
        1. Pruritis / skin rash 28%
        1. Hyperuricemia 11%
        1. Lower respiratory tract infection 8%
        1. Thrombocytopenia 8%
        1. Hypotension 4% 

##Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine

  1. **Pathophysiology:**
    1. Hydroxychloroquine is an anti-malarial 4-aminoquinoline shown to have in vitro (but not yet in-vivo) activity against diverse RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-1 (Touret et al, Antivir Res, 2020). 
    1. It is thought to act through multiple mechanisms. (Devaux et al, Int J Antimicrob Agent, 2020)
      1. **Inhibition of viral entry.** HQ inhibits synthesis of sialic acids and interferes with protein glycosylation, which may disrupt interactions necessary for viral attachment and entry. (Vincent et al, Virol J, 2005). (Olofsson et al, Lancet Infect Dis, 2005).
      1. **Inhibition of viral release into the host cell.** HQ blocks endosomal acidification, which activates endosomal proteases. These proteases are required to initiate coronavirus/endosome fusion that releases viral particles into the cell. (Yang ZY et al, J Virol 2004)
      1. **Reduction of viral infectivity.** HQ has been shown to inhibit protein glycosylation and proteolytic maturation of viral proteins. Studies on other RNA viruses have shown a resulting accumulation of non-infective viral particles, or an inability of viral particles to bud out of the host cell (Savarino et al, J AIDS, 1996; Klumperman et al, J Virol, 1994)
      1. **Immune modulation.** HQ reduces toll-like receptor and cGAS-STING signaling. It has been shown to reduce release of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines from several immune cell types (Schrezenmeier and Dorner, Nat Rev Rheum, 2020)
  1. **Data:**
    1. An expert consensus group out of China suggests that Chloroquine improved lung imaging and shortened disease course. (Zhonghua et al., CMAPH, 2020). Chloroquine will be included in the next treatment guidelines from the National Health Commission, but the specific data on which this is based is not available yet. (Gao et al., Biosci Trends, 2020)
    1. Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (Yao et al., Clin Infect Dis, 2020)
  1. **Recommendation:**
    1. Strong consideration of hydroxychloroquine in patients who require supplemental oxygen who are not candidates for other clinical trials.
  1. **Dosing** (from the literature)**:**
    1. Hydroxychloroquine: 
      1. 400mg PO BID on the first day, followed by 200mg q12 (q8h  if concerns for absorption) for 5-10 days
    1. Chloroquine (not available at BWH):
      1. Second line agent (increased toxicity compared to Hydroxychloroquine)
      1. 500mg Chloroquine phosphate 500mg PO bid for 10 days
        1. Common adverse reactions include: 
          1. Prolonged QT interval and risk of Torsade de pointes
          1. Cardiomyopathy
          1. Bone marrow suppression
        1. Contraindicated in epilepsy and porphyria

##Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE-I) and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARB)

  1. **Pathophysiology:**
    1. The role of ACE-I/ARBs in the treatment or pathogenesis of renal failure in COVID-19 confirmed patients is paradoxical and inadequately understood at this time
      1. COVID-19 enters the same cell entry receptor as SARS-CoV: angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) (Zhou et al., Nature, 2020). COVID-19 is thought to have 10-20x higher affinity to ACE2 than SARS 
      1. In addition to the kidneys, ACE2 is expressed in the heart, lungs, and vasculature.  This has led to the hypothesis that ACE-I and ARBs, which increase the levels of ACE2, might worsen myocarditis or ACS 
      1. However, ACE2 has been shown to have a protective effect against virus-induced lung injury by increasing angiotensin
  1. **Recommendation:**
    1. For outpatients: 
      1. We recommend against discontinuing outpatient ACE-I/ARBs 
        1. The American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association and Heart Failure Society of America joint statement recommends against discontinuing ACE-I and ARBs in patients with COVID-19 (Bozkurt et al., HFSA/ACC/AHA Statement Addresses Concerns Re: Using RAAS Antagonists in COVID-19, 2020) 
    1. For inpatients:
      1. We recommend strong consideration of discontinuing and avoiding ACE-I/ARBs in inpatients given the risk of kidney injury in severe illness (see Chapter 7, “Other Guidance”)

##Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
  1. **Pathophysiology:**
    1. SARS-CoV-2 binds to cells via ACE2. ACE2 is upregulated by ibuprofen in animal models, and this might contribute (see “Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE-I) and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARB)” section)
  1. **Recommendation:**
    1. Consider acetaminophen instead of NSAIDs if possible; risk / benefit should be discussed with patients and treatment team 
      1. Reports from France indicate possible increase in mortality with ibuprofen in COVID-19 infection, but these reports have not been corroborated (Fang et al., Lancet Respir Med,       1. WHO clarified on 3/20/20 it does not recommend avoiding NSAIDs as of 3/18/20. (WHO, COVID-19 Guidelines, 2020)
##Blood Products 
  1. **Recommendation:**
    1. Restrictive transfusion strategy (Hct > 21, Hgb > 7) is recommended unless the patient is actively bleeding or there is concern for acute coronary syndrome 
      1. Parsimony is encouraged given limited supplies (blood drives are limited by social distancing)
      1. Acute coronary syndrome: Hgb > 10
      1. Oncology patients: if possible, reduce threshold to Hgb >7
      1. All others: Hgb > 7
      1. Massive transfusion protocol, as a very limited resource, will need to be activated only by the ICU attending 
    1. Other blood products:
      1. Treat bleeding not numbers
      1. FFP or 4 factor-PCC (lower volume) for active bleeding in setting of known or suspected coagulation abnormalities
      1. Warfarin reversal: use 4 factor-PCC given longer effect and lower volume
      1. Platelets: goal > 30K unless actively bleeding
  1. **Rationale**: Volume overload is of particular concern in patients with COVID-19 so transfusions may be harmful. Randomized controlled trials of ICU patients have shown that a conservative transfusion strategy (Hgb 7) is associated with less pulmonary edema, fewer cardiac events, fewer transfusions (likely fewer transfusion reactions) and no evidence of harm compared to a liberal transfusion strategy. (Hebert et al, N Engl J Med, 
#Chapter 4: Cardiac Complications of COVID-19

##Acute Cardiac Injury

  1. **Definition:**
    1. Defined as troponin > 99th percentile, or abnormal EKG or echocardiographic findings
  1. **Incidence**:
    1. Incidence of 7-22% in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in China (Ruan et al., Intensive Care Med, 2020; Wang et al., JAMA, 2020; Chen et al., Lancet, 2020)  
  1. **Prognostic implications:** 
    1. ACI is higher in non-survivors (59%, n=32) than survivors (1%, n=1) (Zhou, Lancet, 2020)
    1. ACI is higher in ICU patients (22%, n=22) compared to non-ICU patients (2%, n=2) (Wang, JAMA, 2020)
  1. **Time course:**
    1. Troponin rise and acute cardiac injury tend to be late manifestations 
      1. Troponin increased rapidly from ~14 days from illness onset, after the onset of respiratory failure. (Zhou et al., Lancet, 2020) 
      1. Among non-survivors, a steady rise in troponin I levels was observed throughout the disease course from day 4 of illness through day 22 (Zhou et al., Lancet, 2020)
  1. **Mechanism:**
    1. The mechanism is unknown, though several have been proposed, based on very limited data outside of case reports (Zeng et al., Preprints, 2020)
        1. Possible direct toxicity through viral invasion into cardiac myocytes (i.e. myocarditis), though direct myocardial viral infiltration does not seem to have been found in specimens obtained at biopsy (American College of Cardiology,  Cardiologist’s Insights From Treating COVID-19 Patients in China, 2020)
        1. Acute coronary syndrome and demand ischemia
        1. Stress Cardiomyopathy (i.e. Takotsubo’s) 

##Cardiovascular Testing 

  1. **Troponin:** 
    1. ICU patients: Check hsTrop daily and SCvO2 daily
    1. Inpatients: Check hsTrop every other day 
      1. If hsTrop > 200 ng/L or CvO2 < 60%
        1. Obtain 12-lead ECG
        1. Perform point-of-care US (POCUS) if you are trained to do so 
        1. If no new ECG or echocardiographic abnormalities, continue to monitor daily hsTrop and CvO2
  1. **Telemetry:** 
    1. Telemetry should be used for all critically-ill patients
    1. In floor patients, telemetry should be used only in patients who meet <ins>AHA criteria</ins>. It should not be used routinely for every COVID-19 admission
  1. **ECGs:** 
    1. Daily ECGs are reasonable for individuals with severe COVID-19
      1. When possible, print ECGs from the in-room monitor to minimize contamination of equipment
  1. **TTE:**
    1. Do not order routine TTEs on COVID-19 patients
      1. Cardiology consult or a trained provider should perform POCUS if:
        1. Troponin elevation or decline in SCV02/ MV02
        1. Shock
        1. New heart failure (not pre-existing heart failure) 
        1. New persistent         1. Significant ECG changes
    1. If abnormalities are identified (e.g. new reduction in LV EF<50%), a formal TTE should be obtained and cardiology consulted
      1. Where possible order limited TTEs instead of full TTEs to conserve resources
  1. **Stress Testing:** 
    1. Stress testing is likely not indicated in individuals with active COVID. 
    1. Any question of possible stress testing should be directed to cardiology

##Arrhythmias

  1.      1. Case series report the occurrence of unspecified arrhythmias in 17% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n=23 of 138), with higher rate in ICU patients (44%, n=16) compared to non-ICU patients (7%, n=7) (Zhou et al., Lancet, 2020).
    1. There are anecdotal reports of VT and VF as a late manifestation of COVID-19. No specific published findings were identified 
  1. **Workup:**
      1. Telemetry, 12-lead EKG, Cardiac troponin, NT-proBNP, TFT
      1. SCVO2 if central line present (goal SCVO2 > 60%)
      1. POCUS to assess LV and RV function
        1. Obtain formal TTE if abnormalities of any of the above
  1. **Treatment:**
    1. Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter 
      1. Beta blockade if no evidence of heart failure or shock
        1. If significant heart failure or borderline BPs, use amiodarone. There is no known increased concern for amiodarone lung toxicity
      1.  If unstable, synchronized DCCV with 100-200 Joules
    1. Ventricular tachycardia or VT 
      1. Unstable/pulseless: initiate ACLS
      1. Stable:
        1. Cardiology consult (may represent evolving myocardial involvement)
        1. Amiodarone 150mg IV x 1 or lidocaine 100mg IV x 1 

##Acute Coronary Syndromes

  1. **Incidence:**
    1. There is no current available data on the incidence of ACS in COVID. However, we presume that due to the presence of ACE2 receptors on the endothelium, and the known increased risk of ACS in influenza that there is likely an increased incidence of ACS among COVID-19 patients.
      1. The incidence of ACS is about 6 times as high within seven days of an influenza diagnosis than during control interval - incidence ratio 6.05 (95% CI, 3.86 to 9.50). (Kwong et al., NEJM, 2018)
  1. **Workup:**
    1. Elevated troponin/ECG changes alone may not be able to discriminate between:
      1. Coronary thrombosis 
      1. Demand-related ischemia 
      1. Myocarditis
    1. Determination of ACS will rely on all evidence available: 
      1. Symptoms (if able to communicate)
        1. New dyspnea, chest pain, anginal equivalents
      1. Regional ECG changes
      1. Rate of change of Troponin changes (i.e. acute rise suggests ACS)
      1. Echo findings (e.g. new RWMA)
    1. When in doubt, request a cardiology consult
  1. **Management:**
    1. Medical management of ACS should be coordinated with cardiology
      1. Treat with full dose aspirin, clopidogrel (if not bleeding), heparin, oxygen (if hypoxemic), statin, nitrates (if hypertensive), and opioids (if persistent pain during medical management)
        1. Beta blockers should be used with caution given possible concomitant myocarditis/decompensated heart failure
    1. As of the time of this writing, the cath lab will take COVID-19 patients, even if ventilated 
      1. If resources become constrained and door-to-balloon time is no longer adequate, cardiology may decide to use lytic medications for COVID-19 STEMI patients in lieu of PCI

##Pericarditis and Myocarditis

  1. **Incidence:**
    1. Myocarditis and pericarditis may be potential manifestations of COVID-19 and source of Acute Cardiac Injury, based on case reports/case series (Ruan et al., Intensive Care Med, 2020; Zeng et al., Preprints, 2020; Hu et al., Eur Heart J, 2020) 
    1. However, there is currently little evidence of proven pericarditis or myocarditis, either by biopsy or cMRI
  1. **Diagnosis:**
    1. Likely no role for endomyocardial biopsy
    1. cMRI should be discussed on a case-by-case basis with a cardiology consult team
  1. **Management:**
    1. Supportive for heart failure and direct viral treatments 
    1. The use of anti-inflammatory medications such as Colchicine and Ibuprofen should also be discussed with the cardiology consult team as this is evolving 
#Chapter 5: Shock: Septic, Cardiogenic, and Cytokine Storm
##Undifferentiated Shock in COVID

  1. **Definition:**
    1. Acute onset of new and sustained hypotension (MAP < 65 or SBP < 90) with signs of hypoperfusion requiring IVF or vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure
  1. **Time course:**
    1. Patients rarely present in shock on admission 
      1. Natural history seems to favor the development of shock after multiple days of critical illness. 
  1. **Etiology:**
    1. The range of reasons for shock is wide and more variable than for most patients and includes: 
      1. Cardiogenic shock
      1. Secondary bacterial infection
      1. Cytokine storm 
  1. **Workup for new** **undifferentiated shock:**
    1. Assess for severity of end organ damage:
      1. UOP,  Mental status, Lactate, BUN/creatinine, electrolytes, LFTs
    1. Obtain a FULL infectious workup, which includes all of the following:
      1. Labs: CBC with differential. Note that most COVID patients are lymphopenic (83%).  However, new leukocytosis can occur and left-shift can be used as a part of clinical picture (Guan et al, N Engl J Med, 2020). Two sets of blood cultures, LFTs (for cholangitis/acalculous cholecystitis), urinalysis (with reflex to culture), sputum culture (if safely obtained via inline suctioning, do not perform bronchoscopy or sputum induction), procalcitonin at 0 and 48h (do not withhold early antibiotics on the basis of procalcitonin), urine Strep and legionella antigens
      1. Portable CXR (avoid CT unless absolutely necessary)
      1. Full skin exam
    1. Assess for cardiogenic shock
      1. Assess extremities: warm or cool on exam
      1. Assess patient volume status: JVP, CVP, edema, CXR
      1. Assess pulse pressure: If < 25% of the SBP, correlates highly with a reduction in cardiac index to less than 2.2 with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 83% (Stevenson and Perloff, JAMA, 1989)
      1. Perform POCUS if trained to do so
        1. For TTE protocols see Chapter 4, “Cardiac Complications of COVID-19” 
      1. Labs: Obtain an SCV02 or MV02 if the patient has central access, troponin x2, NT proBNP, A1c, lipid profile, TSH
      1. EKG (and telemetry)
      1. Calculate estimated Fick Cardiac Output
        1. CO (Cardiac Output), L/min = VO2/ [(SaO2 - SvO2) x Hb x 13.4)],
          1. where VO2 = 125 mL O2/min x <ins>BSA,</ins> where BSA = [(Height, cm x Weight, kg)/ 3,600 ]½; in patients aged ≥70, use 110 mL O2 x BSA for VO2
    1. Assess for other causes of shock:
      1. Vasoplegia: 
        1. Run medication list for recent cardiosuppressive medications, vasodilatory agents, antihypertensives 
      1. Adrenal insufficiency:
        1. Unless high pretest probability of adrenal insufficiency, we recommend against routine cortisone stimulation testing
      1. Obstruction:
        1. PE (given the elevated risk of thrombosis)
        1. Tamponade (given elevated risk of pericarditis)
        1. Obstruction from PEEP
      1. Cytokine storm       1. Allergic reactions to recent medications
      1. Neurogenic shock is uncommon in this context
      1. Hypovolemia:
        1. Bleeding
        1. Insensible losses from fever
        1. Diarrhea/vomiting

##Septic Shock and Secondary Infections 

  1. **Incidence:**
    1. The reported rates of sepsis and septic shock are not reported consistently in currently available case series
      1. Secondary bacterial infections are reported:
        1. 20% of non-survivors (Zhou et al, Lancet, 2020)
        1. 16% of non-survivors (Ruan et al, Intensive Care Med, 2020)
        1. 12-19% In H1N1 epidemic (MacIntyre, BMC Infect Dis, 2018) 
    1. Concurrent Pneumocystis pneumonia has been reported in at least one case (possibly due to lymphopenia)
  1. **Antibiosis:**
    1. Early empiric antibiotics should be initiated within 1 hour (see Chapter 3, “COVID-19 Therapies and Clinical Trials,” “Antibiotic Stewardship” section)
  1. **Conservative Fluid Management:**
    1. Goal MAP > 65mmHg
    1. Start Norepinephrine while determining the etiology of undifferentiated shock
    1. We do not recommend conventional 30cc/kg resuscitation
      1. Give 250-500cc IVF and assess in 15-30 minutes for:
        1. Increase > 2 in CVP
        1. Increase in MAP or decrease in pressor requirement
          1. Use isotonic crystalloids; Lactated Ringer’s solution is preferred where possible. Avoid hypotonic fluids, starches, or colloids
      1. Repeat 250-500cc IVF boluses; Use dynamic measures of fluid responsiveness
        1. Pulse Pressure Variation: can be calculated in mechanically ventilated patients without arrhythmia; PPV >12% is sensitive and specific for volume responsiveness
        1. Straight Leg Raise: raise legs to 45° w/ supine torso for at least one minute. A change in pulse pressure of > 12% has sensitivity of 60% & specificity of 85% for fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients; less accurate if spontaneously breathing
        1. Ultrasound evaluation of IVC collapsibility should only be undertaken by trained personnel to avoid contamination of ultrasound
      1. For further guidance, Conservative Fluid Management protocols are available from from <ins>FACCT Lite trial</ins> (Grissom et al, Crit Care Med, 2015)
      1. Rationale: COVID-19 clinical reports indicate the majority of patients present with respiratory failure without shock. ARDS is mediated in part by pulmonary capillary leak, and randomized controlled trials of ARDS indicate that a conservative fluid strategy is protective in this setting. (Grissom et al, Crit Care Med, 2015; Famous et al., Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 2017; Silversides et al., Int Care Med, 2017; WHO, COVID-19 Guidelines, 2020)
  1. **Pressor management**
    1. Unless new evidence emerges, standard choices for distributive shock (i.e., norepinephrine then vasopressin) are recommended, with high vigilance for the development of cardiogenic shock, addressed in the next section.
  1. **Corticosteroids**
    1. See Chapter 3, “COVID-19 Therapies and Clinical Trials,” section on “Systemic Corticosteroids”
      1. Stress dose hydrocortisone should still be considered in patients on > 2 pressors 
## Cardiogenic Shock

  1. **Incidence:** 
    1. Heart failure or cardiogenic shock was observed in 23% (n=44 of 191) of hospitalized patients in one case series
      1. Higher rates in non-survivors (52%, n=28) compared to survivors (12%, n=16) (Zhou et al., Lancet, 2020).  
    1. Heart failure or myocardial damage contributed to death in 39% (n=29) of deaths in a series of 68 patients in Wuhan
      1. Most (n=22 of 29) had concomitant respiratory failure (Ruan et al.,  Intensive Care Med, 2020)
    1. Anecdotally, our U.S. colleagues have not seen such high rates of heart failure
  1. **Diagnosis:**
    1. Significant concern for cardiogenic shock if any of the following are present with evidence of hypoperfusion (e.g. elevated lactate):
      1. Elevated NT-ProBNP or
      1. CvO2 < 60% (PvO2 < 35 mm Hg) or
      1. Echo w depressed LV and/or RV function
  1. **Time course:**
    1. Cardiogenic shock may present late in the course of illness even after improvement of respiratory symptoms, and manifest as a precipitous clinical deterioration in the setting of an acute decline in LVEF (see section on “Acute Cardiac Injury”) 
  1. **Etiology:**
    1. See section on “Acute Cardiac Injury; mechanism is unknown, potentially direct viral toxicity, ACS, or stress cardiomyopathy
  1. **Workup:**
    1. Rule out ACS and complete the initial work up as described in Chapter 4
    1. Ongoing monitoring: 
      1. Labs: Trend troponins to peak, SCvO2 (obtained by upper body CVC) or MvO2 q8-12h or with clinical change, Lactate q4-6h,  LFTs daily (for hepatic congestion)
      1. Daily EKGs or prn with clinical deterioration
      1. Trend troponin to peak
    1. All cardiogenic shock cases require cardiovascular consult
      1. PA Catheters may be placed bedside by experienced providers, with preference for use only in mixed shock or complex cases with cardiology guidance
  1. **Medical management:**
    1. Close collaboration with the cardiovascular consultation service is recommended
    1. Goals: MAPs 65-75, CVP 6-14, PCWP 12-18, PAD 20-25, SVR 800-1000, SCvO2 > 60%, CI > 2.2
      1. Note: Achieving MAP goal is first priority, then optimize other parameters
    1. How to achieve goals:
      1. Continue titration of norepinephrine gtt for goal MAP 65-75
      1. Initiate diuretic therapy for CVP > 14, PCWP >18, PAD > 25
      1. Initiate inotropic support: 
        1. Dobutamine gtt for SCvO2 < 60%, CI < 2.2 and MAP > 65.  Start at 2mcg/kg/min. Up-titrate by 1-2mcg/kg/min every 30-60 minutes for goal parameters. Alternative strategies should be considered once dose exceeds 5mcg/kg/min.  Maximum dose is 10mcg/kg/min
      1. Ensure negative inotropes such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and antihypertensives are discontinued
  1. **Candidacy for Mechanical Support**
    1. The benefit of Mechanical Support in COVID-19 is not yet clear. In one study of patients with severe COVID-19, five (83%) of six patients receiving ECMO died (Yang et al., Lancet, 2020). There is concern that the further decrease of lymphocytes from ECMO could contribute to higher mortality. However, this is a very small study and more information is needed
    1. Patients who experience the following should prompt an immediate call to the cardiovascular medicine consult service for consideration of mechanical support:
      1. Dobutamine gtt at 5mcg/kg/min (or unable to tolerate dobutamine due to tachyarrhythmias) and SCVO2 < 60% or CI < 2.2
      1. Lactate > 4 after medical therapy 
    1. The criteria for ECMO and other mechanical cardiovascular support varies among centers and are difficult to develop under typical circumstances. The unclear trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic makes these evaluations even more difficult. Please refer to the separate BWH ECMO and Cardiovascular Medicine guidelines which are in development. 

The following does not reflect the recommendation of the BWH ECMO and Cardiovascular services. However, for the purposes of general education, a hypothetical set of <ins>inclusion criteria</ins> for ECMO or MCS could cover: 
      1. Younger age 
      1. Expected life expectancy >6 months pre-hospitalization
      1. No evidence of solid or liquid malignancy
      1. Able to tolerate anticoagulation
      1. Platelets >50,000
      1. Absence of severe peripheral arterial disease
      1. No evidence of irreversible neurological injury
      1. Able to perform ADLs at baseline prior to illness
      1. Cannot have profound respiratory failure (defined as requiring prone ventilation at time of consult for MCS or having PaO2:FiO2 ratio < 150) (for MCS other than ECMO)

## Cytokine Activation Syndrome

  1. **Incidence:**
    1. A subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 may have cytokine storm syndrome and secondary HLH (Mehta et al., Lancet, 2020). Patients who had cytokine storm developed rapid progression to ARDS, shock, and multiorgan failure (Chen et al., Lancet, 2020)
  1. **Pathophysiology:** 
    1. Neutrophil activation likely contributes to the pathogenesis of cytokine storm and ARDS (Wu, JAMA Intern Med, 2020).     1. Similar patterns of cytokine storm and ARDS have been seen with SARS, MERS (Kim et al., J Korean Med Sci, 2016)
    1. Other studies have suggested that increased proinflammatory cytokines in the serum are associated with pulmonary injury in SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 (Wong et al., Clin Exp Immunol, 2004) 
  1. **Workup:**
    1. Suspect if clinical deterioration with shock and multiorgan failure
    1. CBC with diff, PT/INR, PTT, fibrinogen, d-dimer, ferritin, liver function test, triglycerides, c-reactive protein (CRP) (Ruan, Intensive Care Med, 2020)
      1. CRP seems to correlate with disease severity and prognosis of COVID-19 (Ruan, Intensive Care Med, 2020; Young, JAMA, 2020)
      1. An <ins>Hscore</ins> may be helpful in estimating the probability of secondary HLH in these patients 
  1. **Management:** 
    1. If high suspicion, discuss with ID about the use of IVIG, steroids, cytokine blockade--particularly IL-6 pathway and perhaps IL-1 (see Chapter 3, “COVID-19 Therapies and Clinical Trials,” section on “Anti-IL6 Agents”). While steroids have been implicated with worse lung injury and outcomes, they may be beneficial in the hyperinflammatory state

#Chapter 6: Thrombotic and Coagulation Manifestations
##Thrombotic Disease

  1. **Incidence:**
    1. Unclear incidence, though case reports suggest there may be increased venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19 patients (Xie et al., Radiol: Cardiothoracic Imaging, 2020)
  1. **Pathophysiology:**
    1. The mechanism for VTE are unknown and likely multifactorial:
      1. Systemic inflammatory response as seen in sepsis
      1. Stasis/critical illness
      1. Possibly direct endothelial damage from viral injury/ ACE2 binding
    1. Colleagues from Wuhan have reported finding microthrombi in pulmonary vasculature on autopsy, (Luo W et al, Preprints 2020) which could contribute to local V/Q mismatch or hydrostatic changes causing edema. However these mechanisms remain entirely hypothetical
    1. One theory: SARS-CoV Spike protein can be cleaved by FXa and FIIa. Cleavage of the Spike protein activates it which promotes infectivity. By extension, it is hypothesized that anticoagulation might inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. There is a small case series suggesting dipyrimadole may be useful, though anti-coagulation and anti-platelet agents requires further investigation prior to being used therapeutically (Liu et al., medRxiv, 2020)
  1. **Management:**
    1. Initiate prophylactic anticoagulation therapy for all COVID-19 patients unless otherwise contraindicated
      1. If CrCl > 30: Lovenox 40 mg SC daily
      1. If CrCl < 30 or AKI: Heparin 5000 units SC tid
      1. Hold if Platelets <30,000 or bleeding, start TEDs and SCDs
    1. If the patient is on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or Warfarin for Afib or VTE, switch to full dose anticoagulation (LMWH or UFH, as indicated based on renal function or clinical scenario)
    1. While therapeutic anticoagulation has been used empirically in some severe COVID-19 patients in Wuhan given the microthrombi in pulmonary vasculature (see above), our interpretation of the data is that the risks outweigh the benefits at this time, unless documented DVT or PE
  1. **Prognosis:**
    1. Higher D-dimer and FDP levels track with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome and poorer prognosis. (Wang et al, JAMA 2020, Zhou et al, Lancet 2020)

##Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)

  1. **Incidence/pathophysiology:**
    1. Limited data: 16 of 183 hospitalized patients in Wuhan had DIC (Tang et al., J Thromb Haemost, 2020).
    1. Laboratory changes in coagulation parameters and FDP track with multi-organ dysfunction (Zhou et al, Lancet 2020)
  1. **Time course:**
    1. Median time to onset of DIC was 4 days into hospital admission (Tang et al., J Thromb Haemost, 2020)
  1. **Workup:**
    1. Identify and treat underlying condition
    1. <ins>ISTH DIC score calculator</ins>
      1. If score < 5, no DIC; recalculate in 1-2 days
  1. **Management:**
    1. If bleeding, give blood products:
      1. For elevated PT/PTT and bleeding, use FFP or 4F-PCC (KCentra - less volume, but must discuss dose with HAT/pharmacy)
    1. If not bleeding, supportive care:
      1. If fibrinogen < 150: FFP, cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate (RiaSTAP)
        1. RiaSTAP is less volume, but dose must be discussed with HAT/pharmacy
      1. Transfuse platelets if < 30K
    1. Hold anticoagulation for active bleeding. 
      1. Consider holding anticoagulation if patient requires blood products for supportive care, though clinician should weigh risks and benefits 
    1. Start anticoagulation only if:
      1. Overt thromboembolism or organ failure due to clot (i.e. purpura fulminans)
      1. There has been no mortality benefit of therapeutic anticoagulation in DIC. (Levi et al., Blood, 2018)
  1. **Prognosis:**
    1. DIC is associated with worse survival in COVID-19 patients. Out of 183 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, 71% of non-survivors had DIC (ISTH score ≥ 5) compared to 0.6% of survivors (Tang et al., J Thromb Haemost, 2020)

#Chapter 7: Renal Manifestations 

##Acute Kidney Injury

  1. **Incidence:**
    1. Incidence of AKI in COVID-19 varies widely, but estimates range from 2.1% to 29% 
  1. **Pathophysiology:**
    1. Likely that the most common pathophysiology will be acute tubular necrosis (ATN) driven by shock (Xianghong et al., Natl Med J China, 2020) and in some cases cytokine storm.
      1. Areas for future research: Some have hypothesized that there could direct cellular injury by the virus via angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). COVID-19 uses ACE2 for cell entry. ACE2 is expressed in proximal renal tubules more than glomeruli (Fan et al., Urology, 2020); but it remains likely that shock (and in some cases cytokine storm) are the main causes of ATN. 

  1. **Workup:**
    1. Monitor Creatinine at least daily
      1. Studies find variable onset of AKI, from 7 days (Cheng, Nephrology, preprint) to 15 days after illness onset (Zhou et al., Lancet, 2020).     1. If evidence of rising BUN and/or creatinine, order urinalysis 
      1. Patients may present with proteinuria (44%), hematuria (26.9%)
  1. **Management:** 
    1. Consult ICU nephrology early at the first sign of renal injury for all COVID-19 confirmed patients 
      1. Do not wait until need for RRT (renal replacement therapy)/dialysis for consultation. 
      1. At this time, all confirmed COVID-19 patients should be covered by ICU nephrology, not general nephrology
        1. ICU
        1. RRT Triage
        1. Floor
    1. Managing AKI:
      1. Minimize nephrotoxic agents
      1. Give judicious fluids for suspected prerenal insults, but discuss with renal if any ambiguity (see Chapter 5, “Shock” for conservative fluid recommendations)
  1. **Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT):**
    1. Estimates for RRT range from 1 to 5% of hospitalized patients. Among critically ill patients, need for CRRT ranges from 5 to 23% 
      1. Few studies have reported outcomes of RRT. One case series reported that out of 191 patients, 10 received CRRT, and all 10 died (Zhou et al., Lancet, 2020) 
    1. Renal will be coordinating RRT continuation and initiation 
      1. Indications for dialysis in COVID-19 patients are the same as the indications for all patients
    1. ICU nephrology will determine the need, timing, and modality of renal replacement on a case-by-case basis 
  1. **Prognosis:**
    1. Increased serum creatine, BUN, AKI, proteinuria, or hematuria are each independent risk factors for in-hospital death (Cheng et al., Nephrology, 2020) 
    1. In two other studies, non-survivors had higher BUN and creatinine and higher rates of AKI (Wang et al., JAMA, 2020; Yang et al., Lancet Respir Med, 2020) 
    1. Another study found that higher BUN and creatinine are associated with progression to ARDS, and higher BUN (though not creatinine) is associated with death (HR 1.06-1.20) (Wu et al., JAMA Int Med, 2020)
    1. In comparison, AKI was found in 6.7% of SARS patients. AKI correlated with poor prognosis and 91.7% of patients with AKI died #Chapter 8: Other Guidance
##Liver Disease

  1. **Incidence:**
    1. Up to 53% of patients had abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (Zhang et al., Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol, 2020)
  1. **Pathophysiology:**
    1. Possible mechanisms of liver injury include: 
      1. Direct viral infection of liver cells (2-10% of patients have diarrhea; COVID-19 found in stool samples)
      1. Drug hepatotoxicity 
      1. Cytokine storm
      1. Shock
  1. **Time course:**
    1. In general, liver injury in mild COVID-19 disease is transient and self-resolving. However,       1. ALT > 40 is associated with higher odds of in-hospital death (Zhou et al., Lancet, 2020) 
      1. AST is associated with progression to ARDS but not death; total bilirubin is associated with both progression to ARDS and death (Wu et al., JAMA Intern Med, 2020)
  1. **Monitoring:** 
    1. Monitor LFTs every third day
      1. If on hepatotoxic medications, monitor more frequently in conjunction with pharmacy
      1. If starting Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Chloroquine, monitor LFTs daily
    1. Workup for other etiologies of liver injury with RUQUS, doppler ultrasound, hepatitis serologies, etc as clinically indicated
  1. **Management:**
    1. Consult GI/Hepatology if concern for acute liver failure (severe liver injury with elevated bilirubin, encephalopathy, and INR >1.5)
    1. Run medication list for all possible offending agents and discontinue where possible
    1. N-Acetyl-Cysteine is not recommended at this time due to significant volume load. Chinese studies refer to giving “liver protective drugs” in case of severe liver injury but we recommend against this for now
    1. There are no current guidelines for treatment of COVID-19 patients with underlying cirrhosis, but societies such as AASLD are working on registries of these patients

##Considerations for Oncology Patients  
  1. **Data:**
    1. As of 3/16/2020, there is no available published data specific to COVID19 management in oncologic or immunosuppressed patients
  1. **Oncology Consultation/Coverage:** 
    1. For established DFCI patients, oncology consultation and guidance is provided by each patient’s primary oncologist (or coverage). 
      1. Contact primary oncologist via page not the general pager 
  1. **Prognosis:** 
    1. Many patients have reasonable or even good prognoses with current therapies. Do not assume a prognosis, involve outpatient attending
  1. **Meds:** 
    1. Check in Epic medications tab and in “Research: Active” tab 
  1. **Workup:** 
    1. Labs: 
      1. Weekly glucan/galactomannan in neutropenic/transplant patients.
      1. Specific patient populations may require additional monitoring (such as CMV, EBV monitoring in transplant patients – ask outpatient team).
    1. Exam: 
      1. Examine catheters (port, CVC, others) daily. 
      1. Avoid rectal exams in neutropenic patients, but examine the perirectal area if symptoms or persistent fevers. 
      1. Do not give per rectum therapies to neutropenic patients.
  1. **Pain management:** 
    1. Patients with cancer-related pain may have high opiate needs at baseline. Opiates should not be stopped but type may need to be adjusted in the setting of respiratory failure, renal injury, or liver injury.
      1. Pain / Palliative Care service can help guide dose titrations in these situations.
  1. **Goals of Care:** 
    1. Involve primary team whenever possible (recognizing that in critical/emergent situations may not be possible)
  1. **Anticoagulation:**
    1. Thrombosis prophylaxis should be initiated for all patients unless otherwise contraindicated, given that both COVID19 infection and malignancy increase thrombotic risk, particularly with solid tumors
      1. See  “Thrombotic disease” for guidelines on both prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation
      1. Remember to hold if Platelets <30,000
  1. **Patients with Heme Malignancy and Stem Cell Transplant:**
    1. Daily exam: Findings are more subtle or absent in neutropenic and immune suppressed patients. Examine catheters daily. Avoid rectal exam
  1. **Febrile Neutropenia:**
    1. Definition:
      1. ANC < 500 cells/mm3 AND T ≥ 101F or T ≥ 100.5 for 1hr
    1. Workup: 
      1. blood cultures from peripheral (ideally two sets), and each lumen of central line (label clearly); UA/sed with urine culture (UA may not be as informative with neutropenia); Glucan and galactomannan (if not checked recently), sputum if able, CXR
        1. Continue DAILY blood cultures while febrile
        1. Monitor serum galactomannan and 1-3-beta glucan once weekly
        1. Any positive glucan or galactomannan prompts ID consult.
    1. Initial Empiric Antibiotics:
      1. GNRs: Ceftazidime -OR- Cefepime 
        1. Alternatives (2nd line) Piperacillin-tazobactam or (3rd line) meropenem
      1. GPCs: add Vancomycin if hemodynamically unstable, or if MRSA pneumonia or catheter-associated infection is suspected. Check dosing with pharmacy if able
    1. Removal of lines:
      1. Catheter removal should be discussed if associated infection is suspected - involve primary oncologist and/or ID team to weigh risks and benefits, given that not all lines require removal.
    1. Persistent Neutropenic Fever:
      1. If fever persists x3 days despite antibiotics 
        1. Micafungin 100mg IV daily 
        1. Consideration of further imaging even if patient appears stable (discuss with oncology / ID)
    1. Antiinfective course:
      1. Antiinfectives should be continued until the patient has met all of these criteria: 
        1. (a) clinically improved and 
        1. (b) has been afebrile for 48h and 
        1. (c) has been non-neutropenic for 48h.
  1. **Transfusions:** 
    1. Blood bank reivews order and will release appropriate product (i.e. irradiated, leukoreduced, etc)
      1. RBC transfusion if Hgb < 7 or Hct < 21
      1. Platelet transfusion if Platelets < 10K. Higher transfusion goals if needed for procedures or if active bleeding:
        1. Plts > 20K if mild bleeding (i.e. epistaxis, line oozing) or if patient has rigors
        1. Plts > 50K if more serious bleeding; may be higher for CNS bleeding or neurosurgery required
      1. Cryoprecipitate transfusion if fibrinogen < 100
      1. FFP transfusion if procedure needed. INR of FFP = ~1.4
  1. **Patients with Solid Tumors:**
    1. Patients with solid tumors are at very high risk of thrombosis but at lower risk of infection than most heme malignancy patients
    1. Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) do not significantly immunosuppress patients when used alone
      1. Most common are CTLA4 inhibitor (ipilimumab) and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, durvalumab, atezolizumab and avelumab).
    1. Immune toxicity: 
      1. If patient develops organ dysfunction, it may be due to immune toxicity- consult the service team of the involved organ system and inform primary oncologist
      1. Common immune toxicities include pneumonitis / respiratory failure (may be difficult to distinguish between COVID19 disease or may be aggravated by COVID19 infection), colitis, endocrine dysfunction (thyroid, pituitary / hypothalamic, adrenal), nephritis. Less common hepatitis, meningitis, dermatitis.
        1. Check TSH, ACTH, cortisol, Tspot, HIV, HBV, HCV serologies if concerned
      1. Immune toxicities are usually treated with high dose steroids - risks and benefits must be weighed immediately with primary oncologist and ID consult teams if immune toxicity is suspected concurrent with COVID19 infection.
      1. <ins>BWH/DFCI iTox guidelines</ins> can be found on the DFCI intranet

##Goals of Care

  1. **Assess understanding and sign Health Care Proxy form on admission:**
    1. In conscious patients, review or sign Health Care Proxy form
    1. Make sure families are aware that patients with significant comorbid illnesses or who have poor baseline functional or health status decompensate rapidly and have very high mortality due to COVID-19 (see Chapter 1, “Non-ICU Management, Triage, Transfers”) 
  1. **Goals of Care should be documented and focus on:**
    1. A patient’s desired quality of life
    1. Tolerance for/ desire for invasive measures
    1. Understanding of disease process 

##Management of Cardiac Arrest

  1. **Early goals of care conversations are imperative**
    1.  The aim is to avoid unnecessary codes in patients without a reversible underlying condition
  1. **Health care workers should be protected in code situations:** 
    1. PPE should be worn by all healthcare workers, even if donning prolongs time the patient spends a low-flow state during cardiac arrest
    1. Codes should be run with an automated compression device where available and minimal personnel
  1. **Full code guidelines are forthcoming and will be included here when available**

We built the first iteration of these guidelines “from the bottom up” in less than a week with the input of over 50 people. With the help of our readers, we expect to correct and revise as we as a society learn about COVID-19. 

We hope that this pandemic brings with it a new era of collaborativity and speed in Evidence Based Medicine. We welcome all help, and will be restructuring this to be more navigable and collaborative in the coming days.

Currently we are looking for ongoing section editors, please email <ins>BWHCOVIDGuidelines@gmail.com</ins> if you are interested.

#ADDENDUM: COVID ICU Bundle Checklist  

Rationale: Use of a daily checklist ensures that routine quality measures are in place for each patient.  Review Bundle Checklist at the end of each patient’s presentation, every day.  <ins>Each section should be performed unless there is a contraindication or barrier to implementation</ins>. If a contraindication is present, discuss how barriers may be overcome. 

**Ventilator** 
🗆 Spontaneous Awakening Trial (SAT)
= turn off sedation 
🗆 Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT)
= Place patient on Pressure Support 5/5
- Perform SAT & SBT concurrently if able
- Contraindications to SAT/SBT include FiO2 > 50%, PEEP > 8, O2 sat < 90%, pH < 7.30, SBP < 90 or MAP < 60, paralysis, intracranial pressure >15, concern for significant bleeding
🗆 If ARDS: goal Vt 4-6 cc/kg of ideal body weight (calculated by height), plateau pressure < 30

🗆 Head of bed at >30 degrees 
🗆 Oral care is ordered 

**Sedation / Delirium**
🗆 Ask: Is patient delirious (CAM+)? 
🗆 Review med list for any deliriogenic medications and discontinue/change where possible
🗆 Define RASS goal
🗆 Record QTc daily, consider changing medications if QTc > 500 

**Restraints**
🗆 Ask: Are restraints needed? 
🗆 Sign necessary restraint orders
🗆 Discuss barriers to removing restraint orders 

**Mobility** 
🗆 Consult PT for early mobility
- Contraindications include: deep sedation, paralysis

**Pressure Ulcers**
🗆 Ask: Are pressure ulcers present? Is a wound care consult needed? 
🗆 Discuss whether any changes are needed to ulcer management plan

**DVT prophylaxis**
🗆 Review patient’s current DVT prophylaxis orders and adjust if needed 
- Contraindications to LMWH DVT ppx include AKI (switch to UFH TID), clinically significant bleeding (hold pharmacologic), platelet count < 30K (hold pharmacologic)
- Add sequential compression boots if holding pharmacologic prophylaxis

**GI / Nutrition** 
🗆 Famotidine 20mg IV BID in intubated patients; Pantoprazole 20-40mg IV daily if history of GERD or GI bleed
🗆 Review nutrition, consult nutrition if not already done.  While awaiting nutrition input, start enteral nutrition: 
- In most patients, Osmolite 1.5 @10mL/hr, advance by 20mL Q6h to goal 50mL/hr
- If renal failure and high K or phos: Nepro @ 10mL/hr, advance by 10mL Q6h to goal 40mL/hr
- MVI with minerals daily 
- thiamine 100mg daily x3 days
- folate 1mg daily x 3 days
🗆 Ask: Is bowel regimen adequate? Make changes if necessary. 
🗆 Review glucose range over past 48h and insulin regimen, adjust regimen if needed. 
- Goal glucose range is 70-180

**Tubes / Lines / Drains**
🗆 List all tubes / lines / drains and discuss if any can be removed or should be changed

**Patient / Family Communication** 
🗆 Discuss if patient has healthcare making capacity - if not, activate healthcare proxy 
🗆 Update families by phone 
- Suggest RN update at least daily 
- MD update Q3 days, with any significant clinical change, or per family request

**Disposition**
🗆 Discuss anticipated dispo, barriers to dispo

**Code Status**
🗆 Review current code status, discuss if goals of care are realistic with prognosis - if not, discuss with patient / family
